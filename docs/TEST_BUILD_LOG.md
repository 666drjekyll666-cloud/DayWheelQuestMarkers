# Test Build Log

Every handed DLL is immutable and tied to exact committed source plus build artifact identity.

## 1.0.21 — accepted public stable

- Date accepted: 2026-09-11.
- Development branch: `dev/1.0.21`.
- Exact executable/build source: `7638343438dad6cdf522e37595f3fb21b442193a`.
- Candidate ref: `candidate/1.0.21` at the same commit.
- Accepted baseline ref: `baseline/1.0.21-accepted` at the same commit.
- Runtime logic base: accepted 1.0.17 reminder/actionability logic, with the public marker-resource implementation used by 1.0.21.
- Source audit: `QuestRuleCache.cs`, `CrossOwnerRuleCache.cs`, `SessionCacheRebinder.cs`, `LoadingCachePrewarmGate.cs`, `VerifiedBridgeReminderRules.cs`, and `ReflectionUtil.cs` are byte-identical to the accepted 1.0.17 blobs.
- CI: run `34639351706`, job `103394957694`, success, 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Artifact: `DayWheelQuestMarkers-1.0.21` (`10278859840`), archive digest `sha256:046c957736a4d028fbe7cb12841797fe8f72673cf901d03e6fbf611c6d3d80ac`.

- Raw DLL SHA-256: `b609da9c35cd40ce09259a4c580e371dad15c3889f4e5cf9bdb0190a00e23c9a`.
- Requested regression test: marker rendering/category correctness, menu/HUD lifecycle, multiple markers/categories if convenient, and no noticeable post-load hitch.
- Player result: **accepted**. User reported that everything works correctly.
- Supplied runtime log confirms `Day Wheel Quest Markers 1.0.21` loaded, a developed-save cache prewarm completed in 517.73 ms with `supported=75` and `cross-owner tasks=8`, and the mod reached its normal `Ready` state. One final-runtime revalidation fell back to the safe post-load rebuild path; the player reported no visible problem or noticeable regression.
- Stable distribution: publish the exact tested DLL above to GitHub Release `v1.0.21`; do not rebuild under the same version.
